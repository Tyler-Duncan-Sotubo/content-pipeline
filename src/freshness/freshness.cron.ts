/**
 * Two jobs:
 * - refresh pass: hourly, 8am-4pm WAT (9 runs/day) - reads the stored
 *   post-ID index (freshness-state.json) and refreshes up to 60 overdue
 *   posts per run (no day-group rotation - every overdue post is a
 *   candidate every run). A missed run doesn't skip posts: the next run
 *   just finds them still overdue and catches up.
 * - index rebuild: daily - re-scans categories to pick up newly published
 *   posts into the index. Bloggers publish manually every day (not just the
 *   pipeline's own automated posts), so a new post needs same-day discovery,
 *   not up to a week's delay - buildIndex() itself is lightweight (just
 *   checks post IDs per category, no content edits), so daily is cheap.
